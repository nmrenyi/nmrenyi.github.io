## Problem Description
> We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

## My Solution

Use "Decrease and Conquer". Judge from the beginning of the vector, then pop out the beginning one or two characters according to their composition. 

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int>& getNext(vector<int>& bits) {
        if (bits[0] == 1 && bits[1] == 1) {
            bits.erase(bits.begin(), bits.begin() + 2);
            return bits;
        }
        else if (bits[0] == 1 && bits[1] == 0) {
            bits.erase(bits.begin(), bits.begin() + 2);
            return bits;
        }
        else if (bits[0] == 0 && bits[1] == 0) {
            bits.erase(bits.begin(), bits.begin() + 2);
            return bits;
        }
        else {  // (bits[0] == 0 && bits[1] == 1) 
            bits.erase(bits.begin(), bits.begin() + 1);
            return bits;
        }
    }
    bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int>& bits) {
        if (bits.size() >= 3) {
            return isOneBitCharacter(getNext(bits));
        }
        if (bits.size() == 1) {
            if (bits[0] == 0)
                return true;
            return false;
        }
        else {  // bits.size() == 2
            if (bits[0] == 1)  // 10, 11
                return false;
            return true;  // only 00, 01 is not possible
        }

    }
};

```
But it has something to improve, like eliminating the tail recursion and make the logic clearer.

## Reference Solution
Use the **internal properties** of the problem. 
If we begin from the start of the vector, if the beginning is 0, then it must be a single character here, which enables us to move forward 1 character. If the beginning is 1, then this 1 and the next character must be a two character here, which enables us to move forward 2 characters. We only need to check where we stop in this manner. If we stop where there are no characters left, then the last zero must be a component of a two character, otherwise it must be a single character.

The reference Python Code is shown below. More info on https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/solution/

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits):
        i = 0
        while i < len(bits) - 1:
            i += bits[i] + 1
        return i == len(bits) - 1
```
