## Problem Description
> Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

More info see https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/

## My Solution

At first I want to use dynamic programming, but I stuck in 1D dynamic programming. That is `dp[i]` means the longest palindromic substring with `s[i]` as the ending. But in this way it's hard to make use of the properties. The following 2 properties are what we can easily observe.

- `s[i]` itself is a palindromic substring.
- [`s[i], s[j]`] is a palindromic substring if [`s[i + 1], s[j - 1]`] is a palindromic substring and `s[i] == s[j]`


A more natural approach goes like this: we can use a 2D array denoting the substring with start at `i` and ending at `j`.
Then we can make a more natural state transfer.

Basis:

$dp[i][i] = True$

$dp[i][i + 1] = True$ if $s[i] == s[j]$

Reduction:

- $dp[i][j]$ is a palindromic substring if $dp[i][j]$ is palindromic and $s[i] == s[j]$


So it's important to notice what the question really looks like and select the corresponding approach and data structure for it.


The solution goes below. Time and space complexity are both $O(n^2)$.

```C++

class Solution {
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        if (s.size() <= 1)
            return s;
        int len = s.size();
        vector<vector<bool>>dp(len);
        for (int i = 0;i < len; i++) {
            dp[i] = vector<bool>(len, 0);
            dp[i][i] = 1;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
            dp[i][i + 1] = (s[i] == s[i + 1]);
        }
        for (int i = 2; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j + i < len; j++) {
                dp[j][j + i] = (dp[j + 1][j + i - 1] && (s[j] == s[j + i]));
            }
        }

        int max_interval = -1;
        int left = -1, right = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < len; j++) {
                if (dp[i][j]) {
                    if (max_interval < j - i) {
                        max_interval = j - i;
                        left = i;
                        right = j;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return s.substr(left, right - left + 1);
    }
};

```

## Other solutions

Another natural solution is to expand from the center to other characters. Or we can check the reversed string and find the longest common substring with the original string and make sure the found substring has the same index. (Clearer explanation is [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/solution/)) These 2 algorithms both have $O(n^2)$ time complexity.

There is an $O(n)$ solution called Manacher's Algorithm, which seems quite complicated.

## Another Solution From XuYi

We can enumerate the possible palindromic substring midpoints(2n-1 possible midpoints). Then use binary search to find the length of the palindromic substring. To judge if a substring is palindromic, we need to calculate the hash value of the given string in advance, from back to front and from front to back. (More details see [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/palindrome-substring-queries/))

Calculating each hash value needs $O(logn)$ time. We need to calculate $2n$ hash values so that building the hashtable costs $O(nlogn)$ time.
And enumerating and binary searching the palindromes costs also $O(nlogn)$ time. Totally it's $O(nlogn)$ time complexity.
